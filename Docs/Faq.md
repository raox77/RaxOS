- Why am not using NTLite license

I can`t afford to renew license, even if i could am not gonna pay.

Why? Using Spddl Winiso-Wizard is much eaiser to use because i know what i removed unlike NTLite which is not open-source.

0. First we need a Windows ISO, if it is not clear which build number from which channel is the latest recommend using the overview [changewindows.org](https://changewindows.org/timeline/pc).
The build number we can search and configure on [UUP dump](https://uupdump.net/).
- Language: (personal preferences)
- Edition: I recommend to select only "Windows Pro"
- Download method: "Download and convert to ISO" with the checkbox "Include updates (Windows converter only) & "Run component cleanup (Windows converter only) & Integrate .NET Framework 3.5 (Windows converter only)"
- After Downloading the .Zip Extract it then Run uup_download_windows.cmd.
1. Download the github files [Here](https://github.com/raox77/RaxOS/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Place your .ISO file into _UUPdump_ISO
3. Open Powershell and cd to wherever HereWeGo.ps1 is located and then run it ***Do not run it by right clicking and Run with Powershell***
4. If you got any error "about_Execution_Policies" run this command in powershell 
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```
5. Or open cmd cd to Root folder and run this command
```bat
PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File _HereWeGo.ps1
```
