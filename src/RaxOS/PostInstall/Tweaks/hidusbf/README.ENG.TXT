1. Short description.
  This driver/program is intended to "overclock" USB mice (or 
  other devices) under Windows 98, 98SE, ME, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, 
  7, 8, 8.1, 10, 11 including x64 versions.
  Also may be used for downclocking (and downclocking shall work always).

  !!! Warning - overclocking may not work for Low Speed USB devices which 
  controlled by non Microsoft USB stack, like OEM USB 3.x drivers
  at Windows 7 or with the newest Microsoft drivers.

  !!! Warning 2 - you SHALL disable Secure Boot or modify the Registry
  accordingly to enable loading of Microsoft unsigned drivers to load
  HIDUSBF driver successfully under Windows 10 x64 version 1607
  (Anniversary Update) or newer versions.

  Program changes rate on selected devices only, not touching other devices
  on USB.

  You can learn more about theory and the program here:
  http://www.overclockers.ru/lab/15925/Razgon_USB_myshi_ili_Software_nanosit_otvetnyj_udar.html
  (in Russian language(*))

  I have personally tested it under Windows 98SE, 2000 SP2/SP4, 
  XP RTM/SP1/SP2/SP3, XP x64 SP2, 2003 x86 SP2, Vista 32 bit RTM/SP2, 
  Vista 64 bit RTM, 7 x86 SP1, 7 x64 SP1, 8 x64, 8.1 x64,
  10 x64 1803, 1809, 1909, 20H2, 21H1, 21H2.
  The first testing on x64 platform was performed by Dark_Cloud under
  Windows XP x64 SP1.

2. Installation.
  1. Downclocking (all devices and drivers) or overclocking of Full Speed USB
  devices is possible always and there is no need to patch system code.

  So, if you use program for this purpose - take drivers
  from directories DRIVER\NTX86\NOPATCH\ and DRIVER\AMD64\NOPATCH\ 
  and replace drivers from directories DRIVER\NTX86\ and DRIVER\AMD64\

  Because Windows 2000 doesn't have restrictions for overclocking Low Speed USB
  devices in driver code for OHCI and UHCI controllers you can use the driver 
  from DRIVER\NTX86\NOPATCH\. Windows 98 and ME also don't have such 
  restrictions, so there is no patch version of driver for these OSes at all.

  If you use your device with pure EHCI controller (without companion 
  UHCI or OHCI controllers and with integrated USB2.0 Hub) or with any 
  EHCI controller through USB2.0 Hub on Windows 2000 then just use
  ordinary version of driver (with patch).
  And there is special unofficial version of USBPORT.SYS for Windows 98 and ME
  without any restrictions of polling rate for such cases.

  2. For OSes begining from Windows XP for successful overclocking of
  Low Speed USB devices is REQUIRED the presence original (not altered
  by other programs) version of system driver USBPORT.SYS 
  (%sytemroot%\system32\drivers\usbport.sys).
  Windows 8 beginning also works with USBXHCI.SYS
  (%sytemroot%\system32\drivers\usbxhci.sys).
  And under Windows 7 is supported Intel xHCI driver (IUSB3XHC.SYS)
  (see additions in HIDUSBFN.ZIP)

  3. Install my driver HIDUSBF.SYS. For this purpose execute SETUP.EXE (there
  should also be .INF and .SYS files UNZIPPED). Click [Install Service].

  In case of HIDUSBF service wasn't installed through 
  SETUP.EXE (button [Install Service]) you may try to do this by OS 
  standard possibility:
  mouse right button click on HIDUSBF.INF -> Install
  It is enough to install the service once for each OS instance.

  Then choose the row with your device and put a checkmark Filter On Device.
  Check that in the column Filter? it says Yes. After that choose desired refresh
  rate. After that push [Restart]. Check if the refresh rate has really 
  changed (for example with the program Mouse Rate Checker).

  If your rate did not change, then you should either reboot, plug-out
  and plug-in mouse cable or stop and then start your mouse in 
  Device Manager.
   
  If the rate does not increase more than 125Hz, then you should 
  try DECREASE it to 31Hz or 62Hz.
  If the rate does decrease, then the driver functions properly, however
  or you mouse is not overclockable; or USBPORT.SYS/USBXHCI.SYS was altered
  or simply too new and so unknown to the program.

3. Uninstall.
  1. Unlink driver from mouse through SETUP.EXE (Filter = Unchecked)
  2. For removing a service and file of driver:
  mouse right button click on HIDUSBFU.INF -> Install
  3. If you have delete a driver but not unlink it from mouse
  then the mouse will stop working. To make mouse working you
  can just delete device, corresponding to mouse in Device Manager,
  then scan for new devices. Or use 
  SETUP.EXE -> [All] or [with Problem] or [with HIDUSBF] Devices ->
  [Filter On Device] is Unchecked -> [Restart]

driver will load only with disabled driver signature enforcement.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Added 2008/04/19:

1. Windows Vista 64 bit checked and work (with disabled driver 
signature enforcement).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Added 2007/05/16:

1. Windows Vista 32 bit checked and work. In principle, version for XP x64 
may work under Vista 64 bit, however AFAIK there is required 
digitally signed driver...
2. Documentation rewritten.
3. Patched USBPORT.SYS move into separate archive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Added 2005/12/26:

1. Driver was enhanced - for its installation under XP is NOT 
required to install corrected USBPORT.SYS. However, if there is observed
some anomalies - you may go back to old working sequence
(corrected USBPORT.SYS + driver in the folder DRIVER\STD).
Thank Alan 'Strider' Kivlin for the idea of patching the code 
of USBPORT.SYS on the fly.
Thank Root for valuable link for implementation.
The same development for Windows XP x64 is still not done - there is a
difficulties with testing.
